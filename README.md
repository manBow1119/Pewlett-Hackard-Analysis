# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
### Project Overview
This project utilized SQL queries in PG Admin to filter large corporate datasets to focus specifically on employees that qualify for retirement, and others who may qualify for a mentorship program. These specific queries confirmed concerns that much of the company's higher-level managers were set to retire around the same time, giving new importance to locating other employees who may be able to fill these roles through a manager mentorship program. New tables were created and exported in CSV files, and an ERD is created to provide overview of relationships between tables.
